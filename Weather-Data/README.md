This code mines weather data from capilal cities around the world and for specific Russian cities. It builds upon the work of https://github.com/soodoku and has been preformed to assist Maria Petrova (UPF) with her research (Summer 2015). I received invaluable help form Anna Steinberg, who compiled a list with the names of the cities, coordinates, and weather stations IDs for me to be able to scrape the data using the present code. 

#1 Weather Stations IDs:

It contains weather station IDs using GHCND database (http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt) and weather station IDs using ASOS (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/automated-surface-observing-system-asos)
(Countries are coded according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard)
